Release notes for MicroIRC
----------------------------------------


Installation
--------------------
Extract the contents of this zip file to a folder in your device. If want an icon in your Start Menu, copy microirc.exe and paste a shortcut in \Windows\Start Menu\Programs. You can optionally provide the name of a profile to load automatically with a command-line parameter. We plan to provide a cab file for easier installation when the program is more mature.

Profiles
--------------------
Profiles are stored as .ini files in the folder of the program. You can edit these files directly with a text editor, but the preferred way to do so is by using the preferences dialog in the program itself. When you press the "Launch" button on the manager, an instance of the client is launched for each selected profile. This way, you can be on several networks or appear with several nicks at once. Use a task switcher to alternate between instances. You can have a maximum of 8 profiles.
